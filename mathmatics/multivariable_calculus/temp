### The fundamental Theorem for line integrals

Let C be a smooth curve given by the vector function r(t),
$a \eqslantless t \eqslantless b$. Let f be a differentiable function of
two or three variables whos gradient vector $\Delta f$ is continuous on C. Then
$$
\int_{C} \Delta f \cdot dr = f(r(b)) - f(r(a))
$$

Suppose F is a vector field that is continuous on an open connected
region D. If $\int_{C}F \cdot dr$ is independent of path in D, then
F is a conservative vector field on D; that is, there exists a function f
such that $\Delta f = F$.

How is it possible to determine whether or not a vector field F is conservative?
Suppose it is known that $F = P \hat i + Q \hat j$ is conservative, where P
and Q have continuous first-order partial derivatives. then there is a function
f such that $F = \Delta f$, that is,
$$
P = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \quad \text{and} \quad
Q = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$

therefore, by Clairaut's Theorem,
$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial{y}\partial{x}} =
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial{x}\partial{y}} =
\frac{\partial{Q}}{\partial{x}}
$$

### Curl

If $F = p \hat i + Q \hat j + R \hat k$ is a vector field on $\mathbb {R}^{3}$
and the partial derivatives of P, Q and R all exist, then the curl of F is 
the vector field on $\mathbb {R}^{3}$ defined by
$$
\text{curl } F = \left ( \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} 
- \frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}\right) \hat i +
\left ( \frac{\partial P}{\partial z}
- \frac{\partial R}{\partial x}\right ) \hat j +
\left ( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}
- \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right ) \hat k
$$

define the vector differential operator $\Delta$ ("del") as
$$
\Delta = \hat i \frac{\partial}{\partial x} 
+ \hat j \frac{\partial}{\partial y}
+ \hat k \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
$$

$$
\Delta \times F = 
\[
  \begin{vmatrix}
  i & j & k \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
  & \frac{\partial}{\partial y}
  & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
  P & O & R
  \end{vmatrix}
\]
$$

$$
\text{curl } F = \Delta \times F
$$

If f is a function of three variables that has continuous second-order
partial derivatives, then
$$
curl(\Delta f) = 0
$$

Since a conservative vector field is one for which $F = \Delta f$, above can
be rephrased as follows
: 
If F is conservative, then cur F = 0.
